Have a well-written README file.
Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.
 

###    Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data
In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this dataLinks to an external site. for your server DB.
Run this command to get the backend started: json-server --watch db.json
Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8001/transactions

Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

###      Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:

See a table of all transactions.
*   Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table * the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend *
*    Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
###    Bonus Deliverables
These bonus deliverables are here if you want an extra challenge and won't affect your score. Make sure to commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.

-  Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table.
